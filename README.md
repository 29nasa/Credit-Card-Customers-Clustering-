# Credit Card Customer Clustering for Enhanced Product Insights  

## üöÄ Project Overview  
This project leverages **unsupervised machine learning** techniques, particularly **K-Means clustering**, to segment credit card customers based on their transaction patterns and financial behavior. The primary goal is to provide actionable insights for financial institutions like **Capital One**, **Chase**, or any other bank offering credit card products. These insights enable better decision-making for targeted marketing, credit risk assessment, product customization, and customer retention strategies.

By analyzing historical customer data, we can group customers into meaningful clusters, offering banks the ability to tailor their offerings and optimize profitability while managing risks effectively.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Key Features  
- **Data-Driven Segmentation**: Cluster customers into distinct behavioral groups based on transaction frequency, credit limit usage, balance, and purchase types (one-off vs. installments).  
- **Actionable Insights**: Provide a basis for strategic decisions, such as identifying high-value customers, reducing credit default risks, or crafting customized credit card products.  
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Visualizations and statistical summaries to explore patterns across clusters and compare financial metrics.  
- **Scalable Model**: The clustering model is flexible, making it adaptable for other financial datasets with similar features.

## üìä Cluster Summary  
The project outputs a **cluster summary table** that highlights key financial metrics for each customer segment. Here's an example of the cluster-level insights:

| **Cluster** | **Balance ($)** | **Purchases ($)** | **Cash Advance ($)** | **Credit Limit ($)** | **Payments ($)** | **Purchase Frequency** | **Cash Advance Frequency** |  
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|  
| Cluster 0   | 5023.96         | 721.18           | 5075.74              | 8215.31              | 4176.81          | 0.33                   | 0.51                       |  
| Cluster 1   | 109.46          | 351.59           | 299.68               | 3628.94              | 1036.11          | 0.32                   | 0.04                       |  
| Cluster 2   | 1253.42         | 2181.42          | 234.49               | 5120.67              | 2147.98          | 0.93                   | 0.04                       |  
| Cluster 3   | 1500.35         | 282.22           | 789.09               | 3226.82              | 954.23           | 0.20                   | 0.16                       |  

These clusters represent various customer personas, such as:  
- **Cluster 0**: High balance, frequent cash advances, and moderate spending. Likely to benefit from a **low-interest rate card** or **cash advance offers**.  
- **Cluster 1**: Low spenders with limited credit usage, ideal for **starter credit cards** with minimal rewards.  
- **Cluster 2**: High spenders with frequent purchases, suitable for **premium rewards programs** and **exclusive perks**.  
- **Cluster 3**: Moderate users with some installment purchases, best suited for **budget-friendly cards** or **installment plans**.

## üíº Business Applications  
1. **Credit Card Product Design**: Create tailored credit card offerings based on customer needs (e.g., rewards for high spenders, low-interest rates for frequent cash advance users).  
2. **Credit Risk Management**: Identify customers prone to high balances or inconsistent payments, enabling preemptive measures to reduce default risks.  
3. **Customer Retention**: Use clustering insights to design loyalty programs, targeted marketing campaigns, and personalized offers for different customer segments.  
4. **Revenue Maximization**: Align promotional strategies with customer spending behavior to enhance profitability.
